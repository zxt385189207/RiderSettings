      <item value="Whether the scroller should process loop jumping while being dragged. Note: if this is turned off while using a small list size, you may see elements missing while dragging near the edges of the list. Turning this value off can sometimes help with Unity adding a lot of velocity while dragging near the end of a list that loops. If this value is turned off, you can mitigate the large inertial velocity by setting the maxVelocity value to a non-zero amount (see maxVelocity)." />
      <item value="pass in a reference to our data set with the offset for this cell" />

      <item value="this cell was outside the range of the data, so we disable the container. Note: We could have disable the cell gameobject instead of a child container, but that can cause problems if you are trying to get components (disabled objects are ignored)." />
      <item value="This member tells the scroller that we need the cell views to figure out how much space to use. This is only set to true on the first pass to reduce processing required." />
      <item value="Second Pass: reload the data once more with the newly set cell view sizes and scroller content size" />
